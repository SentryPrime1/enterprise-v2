# Migration Guide: SentryPrime v2 → v3

## Overview

This guide helps you migrate from the vanilla JavaScript v2 codebase to the modern Next.js v3 architecture.

## Key Differences

| Feature | v2 (Old) | v3 (New) |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Framework** | Vanilla JS + Express | Next.js 16 App Router |
| **Language** | JavaScript | TypeScript |
| **Styling** | Custom CSS | Tailwind CSS 4 |
| **Authentication** | Custom JWT | NextAuth.js |
| **State Management** | None | React Hooks + Zustand |
| **API Routes** | Express routes | Next.js API routes |
| **Database Client** | pg | pg (same) |
| **Deployment** | Cloud Run | Cloud Run (optimized) |

## Database Compatibility

✅ **Good news:** The database schema is **100% compatible** between v2 and v3.

You can use the same Cloud SQL instance without any migrations. The v3 application will work with your existing data.

## Environment Variables Mapping

### v2 → v3 Variable Changes

| v2 Variable | v3 Variable | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `DB_HOST` | `DB_HOST` | Same |
| `DB_USER` | `DB_USER` | Same |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | `DB_PASSWORD` | Same |
| `DB_NAME` | `DB_NAME` | Same |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Same |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | **Changed** - Generate new with `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| N/A | `NEXTAUTH_URL` | **New** - Required for NextAuth |
| `PORT` | `PORT` | Same (defaults to 8080) |

## Deployment Migration

### Option 1: Side-by-Side Deployment (Recommended)

Deploy v3 as a new service while keeping v2 running:

```bash
# Deploy v3 as new service
gcloud run deploy sentryprime-v3 \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated

# Test v3 thoroughly
# Once confident, update DNS to point to v3
# Delete v2 service when ready
```

### Option 2: Direct Replacement

Replace v2 with v3 in the same service:

```bash
# Backup v2 first!
gcloud run services describe sentryprime-v2 --format=yaml > v2-backup.yaml

# Deploy v3 to same service name
gcloud run deploy sentryprime-enterprise-v2 \
  --source /path/to/sentryprime-v3 \
  --region us-central1
```

## Feature Parity Checklist

### ✅ Implemented in v3

- [x] User authentication (login/signup)
- [x] Dashboard with statistics
- [x] Accessibility scanning (single + multi-page)
- [x] Scan history and results
- [x] Platform integrations UI (WordPress, Shopify, Custom)
- [x] Database persistence
- [x] Cloud Run deployment
- [x] Environment configuration

### ⏳ Not Yet Implemented (Coming Soon)

- [ ] Guided fixing modal
- [ ] AI fix generation integration
- [ ] Before/after preview
- [ ] One-click deployment to platforms
- [ ] Scheduled automated scans
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Bulk operations
- [ ] Financial impact calculator
- [ ] Billing/subscription management

### 🔄 Backend Engines (Reusable)

The v2 backend engines can be integrated into v3:

```
v2/lib/engines/
├── wordpress-engine.js    → Can be ported to v3/lib/engines/
├── shopify-engine.js      → Can be ported to v3/lib/engines/
├── deployment-engine.js   → Can be ported to v3/lib/engines/
└── ai-fix-generator.js    → Can be ported to v3/lib/engines/
```

## User Migration

### Existing Users

Users from v2 will need to **create new accounts** in v3 because:

1. Password hashing may differ
2. Session management is different (NextAuth vs custom JWT)
3. User table structure is compatible but authentication flow changed

### Migration Script (Optional)

If you want to migrate existing users:

```sql
-- Users can keep their accounts, but passwords need reset
-- Option 1: Force password reset for all users
UPDATE users SET password_hash = NULL WHERE created_at < NOW();

-- Option 2: Notify users to reset passwords via email
-- (Implement password reset flow in v3)
```

## Testing Checklist

Before switching from v2 to v3 in production:

- [ ] Test user signup and login
- [ ] Run test scans on sample websites
- [ ] Verify scan results display correctly
- [ ] Test platform integrations (WordPress, Shopify)
- [ ] Check database connections
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set
- [ ] Test with production data (read-only first)
- [ ] Load test with expected traffic
- [ ] Check Cloud Run logs for errors
- [ ] Verify memory and CPU usage

## Rollback Plan

If v3 has issues, rollback to v2:

```bash
# Option 1: Revert to previous revision
gcloud run services update-traffic sentryprime-enterprise-v2 \
  --to-revisions PREVIOUS_REVISION=100

# Option 2: Redeploy v2 from backup
gcloud run services replace v2-backup.yaml
```

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | v2 | v3 | Notes |
|--------|----|----|-------|
| **Cold Start** | ~3s | ~2s | Next.js optimized |
| **Memory Usage** | 512MB-1GB | 1GB-2GB | Puppeteer + Chrome |
| **Build Time** | ~30s | ~45s | TypeScript compilation |
| **Bundle Size** | ~5MB | ~8MB | React + Next.js overhead |
| **API Response** | ~200ms | ~150ms | Optimized routes |

## Cost Implications

### v2 Costs (Current)
- Cloud Run: ~$20-50/month
- Cloud SQL: ~$10-30/month
- **Total:** ~$30-80/month

### v3 Costs (Expected)
- Cloud Run: ~$25-60/month (slightly higher due to Next.js)
- Cloud SQL: ~$10-30/month (same)
- **Total:** ~$35-90/month

**Recommendation:** Start with same resources as v2, then optimize based on actual usage.

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Database connection failed"
- **Solution:** Verify Cloud SQL connection string format in v3
- Check: `PROJECT:REGION:INSTANCE` format

**Issue:** "Authentication not working"
- **Solution:** Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL` are set
- Generate new secret: `openssl rand -base64 32`

**Issue:** "Scans failing"
- **Solution:** Check Puppeteer Chrome installation in container
- Increase memory to 2Gi if needed

**Issue:** "Build errors"
- **Solution:** Run `pnpm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
- Check Node.js version (18+ required)

## Timeline Recommendation

### Week 1: Preparation
- Review v3 codebase
- Set up staging environment
- Test with sample data

### Week 2: Testing
- Deploy v3 to staging
- Run parallel tests with v2
- Fix any issues found

### Week 3: Migration
- Deploy v3 to production (side-by-side)
- Gradually shift traffic to v3
- Monitor logs and metrics

### Week 4: Cleanup
- Verify v3 stability
- Decommission v2
- Update documentation

## Questions?

- Check [README.md](./README.md) for general documentation
- See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for deployment details
- Review Cloud Run logs for errors
- Test in staging environment first
